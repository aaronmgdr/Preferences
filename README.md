## Opinions and Styles

These are some thoughts I have formed on writing software, specifically code for web based user interfaces. Given free rain I gravitate to these. 



### CSS (and its replacements) 

#### Units 

Use `rem` for fonts size. 
Use `ems` for things relative to those sizes like `line-height`, `letter-spacing`, and potentially `padding` and `margin` directly  between text such as 

Use `px` for most of your padding and margins

Use `flex` and grid's `fr` for layouts


#### Shoulds
The max width of any text should be `45ems` - This is due to readability factors, of course consult with your designer.
